# TimeZoner

TimeZoner is a small project which I am creating to help with my understanding of FED, especially javascript.

## Tasks
* format output fields to readable date-time
* Change timezone options to 2~3 legitimate zones/offsets
* Make actual timezone calculations
* Find out how to populate drop downs with list of time zones (from an API, or library?)
* Check for daylight savings
