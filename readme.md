# TimeZoner

TimeZoner is a small project which I am creating to help with my understanding of FED, especially javascript.

## Tasks
* brush up on bootstrap columns and tidy (don't waste time gold plating)
* Change timezone options to 2~3 legitimate zones/offsets
* Add submit button
* Add JS to run timezone calcs (on submit) and update the output section
* Find out how to populate drop downs with list of time zones (from an API, or library?)
* Check for daylight savings
* add date picker/calendar to date inputs
* add JS validations (remove happy path)
